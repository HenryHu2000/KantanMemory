  - CSV file

### Dependencies (external libraries)
- Junit
- YAML parser
  - SnakeYAML

### Structures
#### Kernel structures
- Daily wordlist generator
  - Wordlist generated consists of two parts:
    - New studying part: A proportion of the words consists of new words added into the memorizing word list
      - Specific amount of words everyday
      - From the software's default wordlist in software's package
      - Choose the word lists based on the user's choice in multiple/custom word list
    - Revision part: Other proportion consists of old words
      - Selected from learning data, according to forgetting curve algorithm
- Process manager
  - Manage individual words
    - Based on how familiar the user is with an individual word, decides:
      - Should the user memorize the word again later
      - The familiarity of that word
  - Manage unrecognized word list
    - Add the user's unrecognized words again into the daily memorizing word list

##### Data-related structures
- Data reader
  - Read default word list CSV file from the package
  - Read the user learning data of old words
- Data writer
  - Edit the config file
  - Store learning data in YAML format

#### User interface structures
- Command UI
- GUI
  - AVG game-like user interface (future plan)
